# Introduction

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
There is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by Our World Data. The dataset is updated rapidly on confirmed cases, deaths, and testingm throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this assignment, we extracted data for demark only on May 7th. There are more variables in the original data, we have extracted four variables(location,date,total_case,new_cases) in this exercise.
Generalised Additive Models (GAM) will be used. A GAM is a non-parametric model where the linear coefficients of previous model are replaced by smoothers in the case where the response variable can not necessarily be explained by the normal distribution. In this assignment, we will be looking at different smoothing parameters to determine which produces the best model for new cases of covid-19 from January to May 7th in denmark.

# 1
The dataset reads 128 observations by the 7th of May,2020. Inspection of the of the data was performed to ensure there were no missing values. Unusual data was removed from the dataset before undergoing the modelling process.
```
#read data into R
covid<- read.csv("Covid cases.csv")
covid$date <- as.Date(covid$date)
library(ggplot2)
total_date <-ggplot(covid, aes(x=date, y=total_cases))
total_date <- total_date + geom_point() + labs(title = "Total covid cases vs Date", 
                                           y = "cumulative total cases")
total_date 

new_date <-ggplot(covid, aes(x=date, y=new_cases))
new_date <- new_date + geom_point() + labs(title="New covid cases vs Date",
                                             y ="new caeses each day")
new_date
```

There is a trend between the cumulative tatal cases and the date since around the middle of the March until recent May.

The graph of new cases of covid aganist date trended up since March but there is a noticeable decrease in the middle of April.
